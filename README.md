# Rainy City

We built a rudimentary virtual ecosystem (inspired by Rainworld) with three behaviour model driven organisms (lizards, butterflies, trees) and a single, player driven creature to allow for user interaction all within the Unity Engine. Various algorithms were used to emulate the behaviour of each organism's real-life counterparts, i.e. lizards driven by Hill-Muscles and a neural network, butterflies simulated using Boid algorithms, and trees generated via L-systems. All these organisms interact with each other in various ways. The creatures (lizards and butterflies) feature a basic form of cognition to drive their behaviors in predator-prey relationships.
